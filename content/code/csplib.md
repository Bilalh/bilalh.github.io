I maintain the website of CSPLib, a library of test problems for constraint solvers. The site is generated (using Python) from markdown specifications in addition to associated metadata and data files.  I also wrote most of the scripts that perform the generation.

The website is located at [http://csplib.org](http://csplib.org)

The github repository is located at [https://github.com/csplib/csplib](https://github.com/csplib/csplib)
