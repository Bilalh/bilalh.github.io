`shellmarks` is a shell script that allows you to save and jump to commonly used directories with tab completion.

Works well with both `bash` and `zsh`.

2. cd `shellmarks`
2. make install (or just source shellmarks.sh  )
3. source `~/.local/bin/shellmarks.sh` from within your `~.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` (or `.zshrc` for zsh)

Usage
-----

	s <bookmark_name>  - Saves the current directory as "bookmark_name"
	g <bookmark_name>  - Goes (cd) to the directory associated with "bookmark_name"
	d <bookmark_name>  - Deletes the bookmark
	l <bookmark_name>  - Lists the specified bookmark associated with "bookmark_name"
	l                  - Lists all available bookmarks


Addition Features
-----------------

    pd <bookmark_name> - `pushd` to the directory associated with "bookmark_name"
    _p <bookmark_name> - Prints the directory associated with "bookmark_name"
    s                  - Saves the default directory
    g                  - Goes to the default directory
    g -                - Goes to the previous directory

    # Mac OS X Only
	o <bookmark_name>  - Open the directory associated with "bookmark_name" in Finder
	y <bookmark_name>  - Open the directory associated with "bookmark_name" in a new tab

        webfolder	 /var/www/
        localbin	 /usr/local/bin/
    $ g web<tab>
    $ g webfolder	  # cd to /var/www/
    $ o webfolder	  # Open in Finder if on a mac



bookmarks storage
--------------------------
Stored `~/.sdirs` by default.

Set `SDIRS` to use custom location


Environment variables
--------------------

Set `SHELLMARKS_ITERM_SESSION` to a session name to change the session that is launched when using `y` in iTerm2 on `osx`

If `SHELLMARK_PWD` is set, `pwd` is executed after `g` and `pd`
