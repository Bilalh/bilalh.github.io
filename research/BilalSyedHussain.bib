    One approach to automated constraint modelling is to generate, and then select from,
    a set of candidate models. This method is used by the automated modelling system
    Conjure. To select a preferred model or set of models for a problem class from the
    candidates Conjure produces, we use a set of training instances drawn from the target
    class. It is important that the training instances are discriminating. If all models
    solve a given instance in a trivial amount of time, or if no models solve it in the
    time available, then the instance is not useful for model selection. This paper
    addresses the task of generating small sets of discriminating training instances
    automatically. The instance space is determined by the parameters of the associated
    problem class. We develop a number of methods of finding parameter configurations
    that give discriminating training instances, some of them leveraging existing
    parameter-tuning techniques. Our experimental results confirm the success of our
    approach in reducing a large set of input models to a small set that we can expect to
    perform well for the given problem class.

     Constraint modelling is widely recognised as a key bottleneck in applying constraint
     solving to a problem of interest. The Conjure automated constraint modelling system
     addresses this problem by automatically refining constraint models from problem
     specifications written in the Essence language. Essence provides familiar
     mathematical concepts like sets, functions and relations nested to any depth. To
     date, Conjure has been able to produce a set of alternative model kernels (i.e.
     without advanced features such as symmetry breaking or implied constraints) for a
     given specification. The first contribution of this paper is a method by which
     Conjure can break symmetry in a model as it is introduced by the modelling process.
     This works at the problem class level, rather than just individual instances, and
     does not require an expensive detection step after the model has been formulated.
     This allows Conjure to produce a higher quality set of models. A further limitation
     of Conjure has been the lack of a mechanism to select among the models it produces.
     The second contribution of this paper is to present two such mechanisms, allowing
     effective models to be chosen automatically.

    Constraint modelling is widely considered the bottleneck to the adoption of constraint
    programming. The Conjure automated modelling system addresses this by allowing the user
    to write in the high level specification language Essence. This allows the user to use
    familiar mathematical notion such as sets & relations which can be arbitrarily nested.
    Currently Conjure can produce many alternative models, but to select between the
    models, instance data that can discriminate between the models has to be provided. The
    main contribution of this paper, is the automatic generation of instance data from an
    Essence specification.
