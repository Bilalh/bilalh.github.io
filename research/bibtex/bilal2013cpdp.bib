  abstract = { Constraint modelling is widely considered the bottleneck to the adoption of constraint programming. The Conjure automated modelling system addresses this by allowing the user to write in the high level specification language Essence. This allows the user to use familiar mathematical notion such as sets & relations which can be arbitrarily nested. Currently Conjure can produce many alternative models, but to select between the models, instance data that can discriminate between the models has to be provided. The main contribution of this paper, is the automatic generation of instance data from an Essence specification. },
